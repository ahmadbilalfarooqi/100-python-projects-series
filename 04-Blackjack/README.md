Blackjack, also known as 21, is a card game
where players try to get as close to 21 points
as possible without going over. This program
uses images drawn with text characters, called
ASCII art. American Standard Code for Information
Interchange (ASCII) is a mapping of text characters
to numeric codes that computers used before Unicode
replaced it.
