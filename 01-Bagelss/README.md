In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you
must guess a secret three-digit number
based on clues. The game offers one of
the following hints in response to your guess:
“Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the
wrong place, “Fermi” when your guess has a correct
digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess
has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the
secret number.
